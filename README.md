# MovaLab

**Professional Services Automation for the Modern Agency**

MovaLab is a cloud-based platform that consolidates agency operations into a single, intelligent system. Built for marketing agencies, creative studios, and consulting firms with 5-50 employees who are tired of juggling Monday.com, Notion, Harvest, Float, and spreadsheets just to answer "do we have capacity for this project?"

Originally developed for a student-run marketing agency managing 11 client accounts across 8 departments with 60+ members, MovaLab replaces what used to require Basecamp, Monday.com, Notion, MS Planner, and Slack with a single unified system.

## 🎯 The Problem

Professional services organizations struggle with:

- **Tool fragmentation** — Projects in Monday.com, time in Toggl, communication in Slack, capacity in spreadsheets
- **Lack of visibility** — Can't answer "who's overloaded?" or "do we have capacity?" without hours of investigation
- **Organizational chaos** — Team rotations, unclear accountability, tribal knowledge lost when people leave
- **Client communication** — "Any updates?" emails because clients have no visibility into progress
- **Ignored SOPs** — 30-page PDFs that no one reads, informal workflows, inconsistent quality

The result? Burnout, missed deadlines, over-commitment, and margins that erode with every project.

## 💡 The Solution

MovaLab replaces your fragmented tool stack with one unified platform:

| What You Have Now | What MovaLab Provides |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Monday/Asana/Basecamp | Project & task management (Kanban, Gantt, Table views) |
| Harvest/Toggl | Time tracking (clock in/out + manual entry) |
| Float/spreadsheets | Real-time capacity planning with proportional allocation |
| Static SOP documents | Visual workflow builder with enforced handoffs |
| Slack status updates | Automated project visibility for clients and leadership |

**One platform. One source of truth. 40-60% reduction in software costs.**

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 📊 Intelligent Capacity Planning
- **Proportional allocation** — Users on 3 accounts split their 40 hrs/week capacity proportionally (13.3 hrs each)
- **Real-time utilization** — Track individual, department, and organization-wide capacity
- **Multi-level analytics** — Individual → Department → Account → Organization views
- **Prevents over-commitment** — Know if you can take new work before saying yes

### 🔄 Visual Workflow Automation
- **Drag-and-drop workflow builder** — Transform SOPs into visual, enforceable workflows
- **Node types** — Department handoffs, role assignments, client approvals, conditional branches
- **Complete audit trail** — Track every transition, handoff, and approval
- **Guardrails, not handcuffs** — Structure that guides without being rigid

### ⏱️ Flexible Time Tracking
- **Clock in/out** — Start timer, work, allocate hours across tasks when done
- **Manual entry** — Log hours directly on specific tasks
- **Auto clock-out** — Sessions auto-close after 16 hours (prevents forgotten sessions)
- **User dashboard** — View, filter, and analyze logged time with charts and 14-day edit window

### 👥 Dynamic Permissions
- **~40 consolidated permissions** across 15 categories (reduced from 136 via RBAC refactoring)
- **Context-aware access** — Permissions adapt based on project assignments and account management
- **Row Level Security** — Data access controlled at PostgreSQL level, not just application logic
- **Hierarchical reporting** — Clear chains of accountability

### 📈 Multiple Task Views
- **Kanban boards** — Drag-and-drop task management (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done)
- **Gantt charts** — Timeline visualization with dependencies and critical paths
- **Table views** — Sortable, filterable lists for bulk updates
- **Workflow views** — Track projects through custom approval workflows
- **Analytics dashboards** — Performance metrics, resource allocation, project health

### 🤝 Client Portal
- **Project visibility** — Clients see real-time progress without pestering your team
- **Built-in approvals** — Review, approve, or request revisions directly
- **Feedback collection** — Post-project satisfaction scoring and insights
- **Secure isolation** — Clients see only their own projects (RLS enforced)

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Local Development)

> **✨ Zero-configuration Docker setup!** No cloud accounts needed. Everything runs locally.
>
> 📚 **First time?** See our [Complete Setup Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#one-command-setup) for detailed instructions.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Node.js 18.0+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- ✅ **Docker Desktop** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)) - Must be running
- ✅ **Windows users:** Git Bash (included with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)) or [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- ⏱️ **5 minutes** setup time

### One-Command Setup

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/movalab.git
cd movalab
./scripts/first-time-setup.sh
```

**Windows - Choose Your Terminal:**

<details>
<summary><strong>📘 Git Bash</strong> (Recommended for Windows)</summary>

```bash
# In Git Bash terminal:
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/movalab.git
cd movalab
./scripts/first-time-setup.sh
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💻 Command Prompt (CMD)</strong></summary>

```cmd
REM In Command Prompt:
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/movalab.git
cd movalab
scripts\first-time-setup.bat
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ PowerShell</strong></summary>

```powershell
# In PowerShell:
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/movalab.git
cd movalab
scripts\first-time-setup.bat
```
</details>

> **💡 Windows Tip:** All three terminals work! Use whichever you're comfortable with. The `.bat` file automatically finds Git Bash and runs the setup.

**That's it!** The script automatically:
- ✅ Checks all prerequisites (Node, Docker, Supabase CLI)
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Starts local Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Studio)
- ✅ Applies database migrations (42+ tables with RLS policies)
- ✅ Loads seed data (8 test users, 3 accounts, 6 projects, 20 tasks)
- ✅ Runs health checks and verifies everything works

**Setup Flow:**
```
1. Clone repo → 2. Run script → 3. Script validates prerequisites →
4. Starts Docker → 5. Runs migrations → 6. Creates test data →
7. Health check ✅ → 8. Ready to code! 🚀
```

### Start Developing

```bash
npm run dev              # Start Next.js dev server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login:
- **Email:** `superadmin@test.local`
- **Password:** `Test1234!`

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Available Hours
Total team capacity proportionally split across assigned accounts. Prevents over-counting when people work on multiple clients.

### Allocated Hours
Future commitments based on task estimates. Shows if you're over-committing before work begins.

### Actual Hours
Real logged time — the ground truth of work performed. What you bill and what actually happened.

### Utilization
`(Actual ÷ Available) × 100`
- **60-80%** — Healthy with buffer
- **80-95%** — High productivity
- **95-110%** — Risk of burnout
- **>110%** — Critical, redistribute immediately

---

**Agency-Friendly Features:**
- Single source of truth across all client work
